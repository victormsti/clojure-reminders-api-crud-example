# reminders

This is just a simple project including CRUD REST API operations on Reminder entities.

## Prerequisites

You will need [Leiningen][] 2.0.0 or above installed.

[leiningen]: https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen

You also need to have a database locally on your machine. In this project, I'm using [Postgres] in a [Docker] Container

[Postgres]: https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres
[Docker]: https://www.docker.com/

## Running
To start a web server for the application, run:

    lein ring server

This is just for learning purposes.

Enjoy it!
